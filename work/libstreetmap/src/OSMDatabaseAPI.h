/*******************************************************************************
 * LAYER-1 API INTRODUCTION
 *
 * ** This is a more complex API than layer 2 which is built on top of it; 
 * please start with layer 2. The information accessible here
 * is not _required_ for any milestone, though it may help you provide 
 * additional features. **
 *
 * The Layer-1 API handles parsing the OSM XML data, and removes some features 
 * which are not of interest (eg. timestamps, the user names who made changes) 
 * to conserve time and space. It also loads/saves a binary format that is 
 * pre-parsed and so more compact and faster to load.
 *
 *
 * The object model of this library and API follows the OSM model closely. It 
 * is a lean, flexible model with only three distinct entity types, each of 
 * which carries all of its non-spatial data as attributes.
 *
 * There are three types of OSM Entities:
 *    Node      A point with lat/lon coordinates and zero
 *    Way       A collection of nodes, either a path (eg. street, bike path) or 
 *              closed polygon (eg. pond, building)
 *    Relation  A collection of nodes, ways, and/or relations that share some 
 *              common meaning (eg. large lakes/rivers)
 *
 * Each entity may have associated zero or more attributes of the form key=value,
 * eg. name="CN Tower" or type="tourist trap".
 *
 * After processing by osm2bin, files are stored in {mapname}.osm.bin ready to 
 * use in this API.
 */

// Load the (lower-level) layer-1 OSM database; call this before calling any other
// layer-1 API function. Returns true if successful, false otherwise.
// These files are named {cityname}.osm.bin

// Close the layer-1 OSM database and release memory. You must close one map 
// before loading another.

/*******************************************************************************
 * Entity access
 *
 * Provides functions to iterate over all nodes, ways, relations in the database.
 *
 * NOTE: The indices here have no relation at all to the indices used in the 
 * layer-2 API, or to the OSM IDs. You can getNodeByIndex for idx values from
 * 0 to getNumberOfNodes()-1; way and relation indices behave similarly.
 *
 * Once you have the OSMNode/OSMWay/OSMRelation pointer, you can use it to 
 * access methods of those types or the tag interface described below.
 * The most basic method supported by OSMNode, OSMWay, and OSMRelation is
 * id(), which returns the OSMID (a basic class containing a 64-bit integer).
 * The OSMID for any OSMNode/OSMWay/OSMRelation is globally unique (never
 * re-used for any other OSMNode etc. anywehere in the world).
 * For example:
 * const OSMNode *e = getNodeByIndex(0); // Gets the first OSM Node in this city
 * OSMID id = e->id();                   // A 64-bit int (big); unique id

 * Entity tag access
 *
 * OSMNode, OSMWay, and OSMRelation are all objects derived from OSMEntity, 
 * which carries attribute tags. The functions below allow you to iterate 
 * through the tags on a given entity acquired above. For example, for 
 * an OSMEntity* e:
 *
 * for(int i=0;i<getTagCount(e); ++i)
 * {
 * 		std::string key,value;
 * 		std::tie(key,value) = getTagPair(e,i);

 * OSMRelation Functions (OSMRelation is a collection of nodes, ways, and/or relations)
 *
 * The getRelationMembers() function returns the TypedOSMIDs of the nodes/ways/
 * relations that form the relation. 
 * TypedOSMID can do everyting an OSMID can (i.e. it inherits from OSMID), but 
 * it also has a type, which is either Node, Way or Relation.
 * For example:
 * (tid.type() == TypedOSMID::Way) returns true if tid is an OSMID of a way
 *
 * The getRelationMemberRoles() function returns the role of each member of the 
 * relation.
 * A role is a string that may exist (it is optional in OSM) that describes the 
 * role of a member within the relation.
 * For example, a member (a way) of a relation that represents a subway line can 
 * have a "platform" role to represent a platform in that line.

/*******************************************************************************
 * Relationship between StreetsDatabaseAPI elements and OSMDatabaseAPI elements
 * 
 * The StreetsDatabaseAPI intersections, streetSegments, POIs and Features
 * are derived from OSM entities as listed below. You can use StreetDatabaseAPI
 * calls to find the OSMID from which an intersection etc. came.
 * The processing of OSM data to create the StreetsDatabase representation is 
 * complex and is done within the osm2bin program that creates streets.bin files.
 *
 * Intersections: come from certain OSMNodes (only some represent intersections)
 * streetSegments: come from certain OSMWays. A single OSMWay can lead to more 
 *    than one streetSegment.
 * POIs: come from OSMNodes with a tag of amenity; the value is the POI type.
 * Features: can come from either an OSMWay or an OSMRelation (and degenerate
 *      single point features come from OSMNodes). osm2bin extracts features 
 *      when the key or key,value pair on the OSM entity matches our feature 
 *      list, e.g. key = building, or key,value = waterway,river and so on.
