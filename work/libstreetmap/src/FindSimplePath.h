//#define FIND_SIMPLE_PATH

// Returns a simple path (route) between the start intersection (1st object in intersect_ids pair)
// and the destination intersection(2nd object in intersect_ids pair),
// if one exists. This routine should return the shortest path
// between the given intersections but it does not consider turn penalty (in seconds).  
// If no path exists, this routine returns an empty (size == 0) vector.  
// If more than one path exists, the path with the shortest travel time is returned. 
// The path is returned as a vector of street segment ids; traversing these street segments, 
// in the returned order, would take one from the start to the destination intersection.
